# Diggs CodeSpace Templates

Welcome to the Diggs CodeSpace Templates repository! This repository contains Excel templates that generate the code spaces for the Diggs data interchange format for geotechnical data. CodeSpaces are integral to efficiently organizing and exchanging geotechnical data in accordance with the Diggs standard.

## What is Diggs?

Diggs, short for Data Interchange for Geotechnical and Geoenvironmental Specialists, is a standardized format for organizing and exchanging geotechnical data. It provides a structured framework for representing various aspects of geotechnical information, facilitating interoperability and data exchange between different software systems and organizations.
